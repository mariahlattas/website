<h3>Mariah Lattas<br><small>BA(PolIntRel) BMedia <em> Adl</em></small></h3>

#### Profile

A 24-year-old journalist, podcaster, and writer working on Gadigal Land, in Sydney, New South Wales. Currently working as a *Journalist and Newsletter Editor* for pioneering social-first news organisation *The Daily Aus*. My skills sit at the intersection of technology, young people, explainer journalism, and democracy.

I have experience working for youth-focused news media companies including *The Daily Aus, SIMPLIFIED, Radio Adelaide, postup*, and global brands *Ryderwear* and *Apple*. I am passionate about telling important stories, giving a voice to those who do not have the ability to do so and to hold those who do have a voice accountable.
